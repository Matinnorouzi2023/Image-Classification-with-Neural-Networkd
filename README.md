# Image Classification with Neural Networks

This project demonstrates image classification using neural networks. The neural network architecture used here is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is well-suited for tasks involving images.

## Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a deep CNN for image classification.
- **Dataset**: Uses [Dataset Name] for training and testing.
- **Training**: Details about how to train the model.
- **Evaluation**: Information on evaluating the model's performance.
- **Usage**: Instructions on how to use the trained model for predictions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:


## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py


python evaluate.py

# Example code snippet for making predictions
from model import load_model, preprocess_image

model = load_model('path_to_model_checkpoint')
image = preprocess_image('path_to_image')

prediction = model.predict(image)
print(prediction)
